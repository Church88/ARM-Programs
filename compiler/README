For this assignment you will implement a fake compiler.

Rather than having to detect compiler errors, you will scan the standard input
for a line that looks like this:
ERROR X
(where X is an integer).

If you don't see any such lines, you should simply output:
Compilation successful.

Otherwise, *every time* you see an error in the input, you will output:
Error on line N:
>>Missing ";"<<

(N is the line that the ERROR line was on.)
(Yes, the error will always be a missing semicolon.)

In addition, if X (the number after ERROR) is bigger than 0, you will also
output a number of lines of context above and below the error as well.

So if the source code file is:
aaa
bbb
ccc
ERROR 1
ddd
eee
fff

You'd output the missing semicolon error, with a line of context above and
below it, as such:
Error on line 4:
ccc
>>Missing ";"<<
ddd

Look at the sample input and outputfiles in /tmp/compiler for more examples.
There is a /tmp/compiler/input_tester.sh script to test your code.
